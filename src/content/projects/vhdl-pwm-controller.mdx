# Overview

Implementation of a digital controller (PWM/FSM) in VHDL, targeted for FPGA deployment, with a heavy emphasis on testbench verification.

## Problem & Constraints
* Implement a robust Finite State Machine avoiding latches and race conditions.
* Synthesizable VHDL targeted for Xilinx/Intel FPGAs.

## Approach / Design Decisions
Used a strictly synchronous design approach. Wrote an exhaustive testbench to rigorously simulate reset behaviors and edge cases before synthesis.

## Evidence

*(Provide Waveform Screenshots, Block Diagrams, and VHDL snippets here)*

```vhdl
-- Example Snippet
process(clk, reset)
begin
    if reset = '1' then
        state <= IDLE;
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
        state <= next_state;
    end if;
end process;
```

## Results & Learnings
Simulation waveforms matched theoretical calculations perfectly, emphasizing that "it doesn't work until it's simulated and verified in testbenches."
