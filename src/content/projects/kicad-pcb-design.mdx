# Overview

This project showcases the complete hardware development lifecycle of a custom PCB, moving from initial schematic capture to physical realization.

## Problem & Constraints
* Design a reliable multi-layer board ensuring signal integrity.
* Constraints strictly limited to 2-layer routing with minimal vias.
* Component footprint selection optimized for hand-soldering (THT & SMD 0805 or larger).

## Approach / Design Decisions
I prioritized a solid ground plane to reduce noise and carefully managed trace widths based on expected current loads.

## Evidence

*(Provide images of Schematics, Routing, 3D render here)*

## Results & Learnings
The finalized board was successfully assembled and tested. A key takeaway was the importance of thermal reliefs on ground polygons to make hand-soldering significantly easier.
