# Overview

Moving from simulation to physical reality involves introducing tolerances and parasitic impedances. This project details the physical testing of semiconductor components, specifically focusing on biasing a BC547 BJT on a breadboard.

## Problem & Constraints
* Manually determine the component working values for a Diode (1N4005) vs an LED.
* Bias a BC547 NPN transistor to act as a logic switch.
* Implement a Transistor as a small-signal AC amplifier (Microphone Pre-Amp) ensuring $A_U = -10$.

## Approach / Design Decisions
The practical lab approach relied heavily on calculating load-lines. Component values were snapped to the nearest standard E12 resistor series block.
Measurements for the static operating point ($I_B, I_C, U_{CE}$) were mapped out using dual-multimeter setups before injecting the small AC signal.

## Evidence

### Core Laboratory Steps:
1. **E12 Resistor Selection**: Calculated $R_C$ and $R_E$ to achieve the $A_U = -10$ gain, translating ideal mathematical values into available physical components.
2. **DC Operating Point**: Sourced $5V$ DC, mapping out the base biasing resistor divider network.
3. **Dynamic Testing**: Injected a 50Hz sine wave via the Function Generator. Captured the input and amplified inverted output directly on the Oscilloscope.

## Results & Learnings
The hardware matched the expected load-line predictions. A crucial learning outcome was handling the differences between theoretical simulation and physical execution—such as component drift within the E12 series tolerances affecting the final measured amplification factor $\beta$.
